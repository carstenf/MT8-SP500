# S&P500 Prediction - Technical Design Document

## System Overview
A Python-based machine learning pipeline to predict next-day stock movements for S&P500 stocks.

## Architecture
- **Data Layer**: HDF5 file storage with Pandas interface
- **Feature Engineering Layer**: Calculation of excess returns and lagged features
- **Model Layer**: Training, cross-validation, and prediction modules
- **Evaluation Layer**: Performance metrics calculation and visualization

## Data Flow
1. Raw price data → Data cleaning → Feature generation → Model training → Prediction → Evaluation
2. All intermediate data stored as Pandas DataFrames with multi-index (ticker, date)

## Modules
1. **data_handler.py**
   - Responsibilities: Load data, perform cleaning, manage train/test splits
   - Input: HDF5 file
   - Output: Clean DataFrames

2. **feature_engineer.py**
   - Responsibilities: Calculate returns, generate features, scale features
   - Input: Clean price DataFrames
   - Output: Feature matrices and target vectors

3. **model_trainer.py**
   - Responsibilities: Train models, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning
   - Input: Feature matrices and target vectors
   - Output: Trained model objects

4. **model_evaluator.py**
   - Responsibilities: Calculate metrics, generate visualizations
   - Input: Predictions and actual values
   - Output: Performance metrics, visualizations

5. **model_explainer.py**
   - Responsibilities: Generate SHAP values, feature importance
   - Input: Trained models and test data
   - Output: Explanation visualizations
