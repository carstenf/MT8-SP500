# S&P500 Stock Direction Prediction - Project Plan (Modified)

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning classification model to predict next-day price movements (up/down) for S&P500 stocks using historical price data and excess returns as features.

## Data Description
- **Source**: Historical S&P500 stock daily price data
- **Period**: 20 years of data
- **Features**: Excess returns relative to market average across multiple time horizons
- **Target**: Binary indicator of next-day price movement (1=up, 0=down)

## 1. Data Preparation

### 1.1 Data Import
- Import S&P500 historical daily price data using `read_sp500_data` function
- Examine multi-index structure (date-ticker or ticker-date)
- Verify data shape and properties

### 1.2 Initial Cleaning
- Organize data by stock ticker and date
- Verify date alignment across the dataset
- Create metadata about data availability for each stock (first and last available dates)

### 1.3 Quality Gate: Data Readiness
- ✓ Consistent data formatting across all stocks
- ✓ Clear record of data availability periods for each stock
- ✓ No missing values between first and last available dates for each stock

## 2. Feature Engineering

### 2.1 Return Calculation
- Calculate daily returns for each stock: `(close_t - close_t-1) / close_t-1`
- Compute market average return (mean of all stocks) for each day
- Calculate excess returns: `stock_return - market_average_return`

### 2.2 Feature Creation
- Generate lagged excess return features:
  - 1-day to 40-day returns in 1-day increments (40 features)
  - 40-day to 240-day returns in 10-day increments (21 features)
- Create target variable: binary indicator of next-day excess return direction (1=positive excess return, 0=negative excess return)

### 2.3 Feature Preprocessing
- Apply feature scaling using StandardScaler to normalize features
- Analyze class distribution and apply balancing techniques if needed:
  - Implement class weights in model training
  - Consider SMOTE or ADASYN if severe imbalance is detected (>70/30 split)

### 2.4 Quality Gate: Feature Validation
- ✓ No missing values in generated features
- ✓ No look-ahead bias in feature calculation
- ✓ Features show expected statistical properties
- ✓ All features are properly scaled
- ✓ Class balance has been assessed and addressed if necessary

## 3. Model Development with Cross-Validation

### 3.1 Data Partitioning
- Initial feature calculation requires 240 days (1 year) of data
- First 10 years used for cross-validation
- Remaining 10 years reserved for final testing
- For each training/testing period, filter stocks to include only those with complete data for that specific period

### 3.2 Cross-Validation Structure
- 5-fold time-based cross-validation:
  - Fold 1: Train on years 2-4, predict year 5 (filter for stocks with complete data in years 2-5)
  - Fold 2: Train on years 3-5, predict year 6 (filter for stocks with complete data in years 3-6)
  - Fold 3: Train on years 4-6, predict year 7 (filter for stocks with complete data in years 4-7)
  - Fold 4: Train on years 5-7, predict year 8 (filter for stocks with complete data in years 5-8)
  - Fold 5: Train on years 6-8, predict year 9 (filter for stocks with complete data in years 6-9)
- Each fold may contain a different subset of stocks based on data availability

### 3.3 Baseline Model
- Implement logistic regression as baseline
- Apply regularization to address bias-variance trade-off:
  - Implement both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization
  - Test different regularization strengths
- Calculate performance metrics across all CV folds
- Document baseline performance

### 3.4 Advanced Models
- Train multiple model types to capture different aspects of the data:
  - Random Forest classifier with entropy criterion
  - XGBoost model with early stopping
  - Light GBM model for faster training
  - Elastic Net (combination of L1 and L2 regularization)
  - Neural Network (simple MLP) with dropout layers
- Implement stacking ensemble combining all models
- Compare model performance across CV folds

### 3.5 Primary Optimization Metric
- Use balanced accuracy as the primary optimization metric
  - Balanced accuracy = (sensitivity + specificity) / 2
  - Provides robust performance measure for potentially imbalanced classes
  - Accounts for both false positives and false negatives
- Track secondary metrics (F1, precision, recall, ROC-AUC) for comprehensive evaluation

### 3.6 Feature Selection
- Implement Boruta algorithm to identify all relevant features
  - Run Boruta on the training data for each fold
  - Keep features consistently selected across folds
- Create model variants with different feature subsets:
  - Full feature set
  - Boruta-selected features
  - Top-N features by importance
- Compare performance to assess impact of feature selection

### 3.7 Quality Gate: Model Validation
- ✓ Models outperform baseline significantly
- ✓ Consistent performance across CV folds
- ✓ Optimal regularization strength identified
- ✓ Bias-variance trade-off assessed via learning curves
- ✓ Feature selection impact quantified
- ✓ No signs of overfitting
