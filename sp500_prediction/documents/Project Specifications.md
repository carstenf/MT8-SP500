# S&P500 Stock Direction Prediction - Project Specifications

## Project Overview
A machine learning system to predict S&P500 stock movements using technical indicators and historical data, with efficient memory handling and vectorized operations.

## 1. Data Preparation

### 1.1 Data Import
- Import S&P500 historical daily price data using `read_sp500_data` function
- Examine multi-index structure (date-ticker or ticker-date)
- Verify data shape and properties

### 1.2 Initial Cleaning
- Organize data by stock ticker and date
- Verify date alignment across the dataset
- Create metadata about data availability for each stock (first and last available dates)

### 1.3 Quality Gate: Data Readiness
- ✓ Consistent data formatting across all stocks
- ✓ Clear record of data availability periods for each stock
- ✓ No missing values between first and last available dates for each stock

## 2. Feature Engineering

### 2.1 Technical Indicators
1. RSI (Relative Strength Index)
   - 14-day period RSI
   - Momentum oscillator measuring speed and magnitude of price changes

2. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
   - Fast period: 12 days
   - Slow period: 26 days
   - Signal period: 9 days
   - Components: MACD line, signal line, histogram

3. Bollinger Bands
   - 20-day period
   - Upper and lower bands (2 standard deviations)
   - Derived features:
     * Band width ((upper - lower) / middle)
     * %B indicator ((price - lower) / (upper - lower))
     * Middle band (20-day SMA)

4. Momentum Indicators
   - Timeframes: 5, 10, 20, and 60 days
   - Two types per timeframe:
     * Momentum (absolute price difference)
     * Rate of Change (percentage change)

### 2.2 Feature Properties
- Vectorized calculations for all features
- Natural handling of missing values:
  * Lookback periods
  * Index membership boundaries
  * Stock-specific data availability
- Standard scaling (mean=0, std=1)
- Memory-efficient implementation using list-based operations

### 2.3 Target Variables

1. Return-Based Targets
   - Raw returns calculation:
     * Daily price changes
     * Multiple horizons: 1, 5, 10 days
     * Percentage or log returns
   - Excess returns:
     * Stock return minus market average
     * Adjusts for market movements
     * Captures relative performance

2. Binary Classification
   - Methods:
     * Threshold-based: Fixed value (e.g., ±1%)
     * Std-based: Dynamic threshold using rolling std
     * Median-based: Above/below median
     * Zero-based: Positive/negative returns
   - Properties:
     * 1: Upward movement
     * 0: Downward movement
     * Configurable thresholds
     * Horizon-specific calculations

3. Multi-class Classification
   - Three-class categorization:
     * 0: Down movement (below -1 std)
     * 1: Neutral movement (within ±1 std)
     * 2: Up movement (above +1 std)
   - Calculation methods:
     * Std-based:
       - Rolling mean (20-day window)
       - Rolling std (20-day window)
       - Adaptive thresholds
     * Quantile-based:
       - Configurable quantile boundaries
       - Dynamic class assignment
     * Fixed-range:
       - Predefined movement ranges
       - Static class boundaries

4. Configuration Options
   - Target type selection
   - Calculation method choice
   - Return type specification
   - Multiple prediction horizons
   - Adjustable parameters:
     * Rolling windows
     * Threshold values
     * Quantile boundaries
   - Quality validation settings

### 2.4 Quality Gate: Feature Validation
- ✓ No missing values in generated features
- ✓ No look-ahead bias in feature calculation
- ✓ Features show expected statistical properties
- ✓ All features properly scaled
- ✓ Class balance assessed and documented

## 3. Model Development with Cross-Validation

### 3.1 Data Partitioning
- Initial feature calculation requires 240 days (1 year) of data
- First 10 years used for cross-validation
- Remaining 10 years reserved for final testing
- For each training/testing period, filter stocks to include only those with complete data

### 3.2 Cross-Validation Structure
- 5-fold time-based cross-validation:
  - Fold 1: Train on years 2-4, predict year 5
  - Fold 2: Train on years 3-5, predict year 6
  - Fold 3: Train on years 4-6, predict year 7
  - Fold 4: Train on years 5-7, predict year 8
  - Fold 5: Train on years 6-8, predict year 9
- Each fold may contain different stocks based on data availability

### 3.3 Baseline Model
- Logistic regression baseline
- L1/L2 regularization options
- Document baseline performance
- Initial feature importance analysis

### 3.4 Advanced Models
- Random Forest with entropy criterion
- XGBoost with early stopping
